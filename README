Example of N-Gram Language Models

## Problem 2

    python3 p2.py [dev|train|test]
    UNK_PROP=0.1 python p2.py test # set UNK proportion to 0.1

First argument is the name of dataset.

## Problem 3

I have two nearly same implementations, but the smoothing part is different.
In a good engineering practice, they should be sharing code, but ...

    python p3.py [dev|test]
    UNK_MODE=LT2 python p3.py dev # set UNK mode to "less than 5"
                                  # another UNK mode is "LT2"
    python p3_linear.py [dev|test]

Hyperparameter GAMMA and K are set through the global variable in source code.
